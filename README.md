# Movie Recommendation System üé•üçø

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project is focused on recommending movies using a content-based approach, analyzing movie features such as genre, director, and actors to provide personalized suggestions based on your preferences.

# üöÄ Key Features

	‚Ä¢	Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies similar to the ones you love based on their attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Movie Feature Analysis: Recommends films by comparing genres, directors, cast, and more.
	‚Ä¢	Efficient & Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets while maintaining performance.

# Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset. You can download it from Kaggle and place the tmdb-movie-metadata.csv file in the data directory.

# üß† How It Works (Content-Based Filtering)

This movie recommendation system operates using content-based filtering, which compares the content of the movies to suggest similar ones. The main idea is to find movies with similar features (e.g., genre, director, storyline, etc.) by calculating the cosine similarity between them.

Key Steps:

	1.	Tokenization:
	‚Ä¢	The system first tokenizes important features such as movie genres, directors, actors, and plot descriptions. Each of these features is broken down into individual tokens (e.g., words or entities).
	2.	Vectorization:
	‚Ä¢	After tokenization, these features are vectorized using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This process transforms textual data into numerical representations, allowing the system to compare movies based on their content.
	3.	Cosine Similarity:
	‚Ä¢	Once the movies are vectorized, the system calculates the cosine similarity between the vectors of different movies. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, indicating how similar two movies are based on their features. Cosine similarity is used to compare:
	‚Ä¢	Genres (e.g., action, drama, comedy)
	‚Ä¢	Directors (e.g., films directed by Christopher Nolan)
	‚Ä¢	Actors (e.g., movies featuring Leonardo DiCaprio)
	‚Ä¢	Plot/storyline (e.g., movies with similar story elements)
	4.	Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	Based on the calculated cosine similarities, the system identifies movies that are the most similar to the user‚Äôs favorite movies and generates personalized recommendations.

By analyzing these attributes and finding similarities, the system provides movie suggestions that align with the viewer‚Äôs tastes.

This section now clearly explains the content-based filtering process with tokenization, vectorization, and cosine similarity, while also covering how it evaluates different features like genres, directors, and storylines.
